It automates the process of cloning the repository, installing dependencies, configuring data paths, and running baseline model evaluations.\n","\n","## Prerequisites\n","\n","Before executing this notebook, ensure you have access to the following resources:\n","\n","- **Pre-extracted features**: Download the pre-extracted features for 1-second segments and upload them to your Google Drive\n","- **Model checkpoints**: Download the official best checkpoints from the [Box repository](https://utdallas.app.box.com/s/uz3s1alrzucz03sleify8kazhuc1ksl3) (specifically the `error_recognition_best` directory)\n","\n","## Setup Workflow\n","\n","The notebook follows this sequence:\n","\n","1. **Repository Setup**: Clone the repository and initialize submodules\n","2. **Environment Configuration**: Install required Python dependencies\n","3. **Data Preparation**: Mount Google Drive and extract feature files and model checkpoints\n","4. **Model Evaluation**: Execute baseline evaluations for different model configurations\n","\n","## Expected Results\n","\n","Upon successful completion, you should reproduce results close to those reported in the paper (Table 2):\n","\n","| Split | Model | F1 Score | AUC |\n","|-------|-------|----------|-----|\n","| Step | MLP (Omnivore) | 24.26 | 75.74 |\n","| Recordings | MLP (Omnivore) | 55.42 | 63.03 |\n","| Step | Transformer (Omnivore) | 55.39 | 75.62 |\n","| Recordings | Transformer (Omnivore) | 40.73 | 62.27 |\n","\n","**Important**: Use threshold 0.6 for the step split and threshold 0.4 for the recordings split, as specified in the official project documentation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"UiUFeWTG1jnB","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UiUFeWTG1jnB","outputId":"3ec56a4d-9ddc-41a7-a4df-8797f6b31349","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1765644365360,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":181,"user":{"displayName":"Parsa
